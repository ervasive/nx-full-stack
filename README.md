# Fullstack Ecommerce Example

This monorepo contains the source code for a sample project for stock management and ecommerce application. It is built using the following stack of tools and technologies:

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Main datastore and business logic layer.
- [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) - Thin backend server for handling requests and passing them to the GraphQL API endpoint.
- [PostGraphile](https://postgraphile.org/) - Builds an extensible and high-performance GraphQL API based on the underlying database schema.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)/[React.js](https://react.dev/) - Decoupled applications providing web UI for presentation and user interactions with the data.

The monorepo is managed with [NX](https://nx.dev/)

**Status**: Work In Progress

**Disclaimer**: The main goal of the project is to learn and dive into the stack. It is not intended for production use.

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

## Explore the Project Graph

Run `nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
